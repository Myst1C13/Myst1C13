I’m a student who likes building things that actually help me.

Right now, I’m coding pretty much every day — learning by building random useful stuff, breaking it, fixing it, and sometimes accidentally making something cool.

Most of the time, I’m chasing whatever idea grabs my brain at 2 a.m.

Nothing here is perfect. Most of it is just me figuring things out in public.

Let’s see what we end up building. 🚀
